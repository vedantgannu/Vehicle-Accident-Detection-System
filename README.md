# Vehicle-Accident-Detection-System
Microprocessor Systems Project

Using a STM32F76xxx microcontroller as the basis for our processing unit, the goal was to create an accident detection system using an accelerometer and GPS module with the capability to log accidents to a flashdrive for storage purposes. Originally the idea was to send user accident incidents to externel contacts by leveraging a GSM module, but time constraints prohibited the development.

The Final Report.pdf contains the full write up and documentation of the system functionality, testing, along with detailing of the underlying code.
